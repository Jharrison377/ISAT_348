PE provides Technicians with the ability to access the a system from an external, known-good OS, allowing for the identification and removal of malware-related files while processes associated with the malware are not running.</li>
					<li class="reference_list">PE is useful as a software diagnostic tool for the same reason; if the system cannot boot or fix itself for whatever reason, PE can provide access that might otherwise not be possible when booting from the OS on the internal system drive.</li>
					<li class="reference_list">PE is useful for OS deployment, for it can access the network drive and deploy a clean image of an up-to-date Windows OS, while also facilitating the automatic installation of several core applications.</li>
