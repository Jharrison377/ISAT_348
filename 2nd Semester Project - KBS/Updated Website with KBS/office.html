				<h4 align=center>Handling a Call</h4>
				<strong >Overview</strong><br/>
				<span >When a customer contacts the HelpDesk and their issue cannot be resolved by a Representative, the Representative creates a ticket (or "call") in Remedy, and the customer is authorized to bring their system into CampusNet for diagnostics. In certain cases a Technician will have to visit the customer's residence hall (e.g. to investigate a reported bad jack or to perform diagnostics on a desktop machine). After receiving a system, a Technician reads the Call Entry's Initial Call Text in Remedy and performs diagnostics as needed to determine the issue. If the issue is hardware-related, it is generally sent to PCS, the JMU department that handles hardware repair. They are authorized to perform repairs on Apple and Dell computers under warranty. If the issue is software-related, CampusNet generally handles it. While the call is in progress, Technicians document their work on System Status Worksheets, update the Work Log in Remedy, and keep in touch with the customer regarding important issues related to the call. Once work on a system has been completed, the System Status Worksheet is placed in the CampusNet System Status Worksheet binder, the call is closed in Remedy, and the customer is contacted and informed that their system is ready for pick-up.</span><br/><br/>

				<strong >Receiving a System/Assigning a Call</strong><br/>
				<span >After a call is created, the customer will bring their system to the HelpDesk and it will be placed on one of several system racks in the HelpDesk area. Technicians periodically check to see if there are systems on the To-CampusNet Rack. When systems are found on the rack they are brought back to the CampusNet area along with their Hardware Repair Service Request Form and any accompanying accessories. If the system is a CampusNet loaner the Technician starts the loaner check-in process. If the system is a customer system received from PCS, the Technician reviews the accompanying Hardware Repair Service Summary, verifies the repair, and performs any necessary follow-up actions/procedures (e.g. data recovery and OS installation if hard drive was replaced). If the system is a customer system received from the customer for diagnostics, the Technician assigns the call to him or herself in Remedy and then retrieves and begins completion of a System Status Worksheet; all accessories should be labeled with the customer’s e-ID.</span><br/><br/>

				<strong >Diagnosing the Problem</strong><br/>
				<span >The issues seen with customer systems run the gamut from misconfigured wireless network settings to malware infections to hard drive failures. We have a variety of tools at our disposal to diagnose and resolve both routine and non-routine problems. See the Resources & Tools section on the staff page for more information.</span><br/><br/>

				<h4 align=center>Calling the Customer</h4>
					<span class="indent"/><span ><h5><u>Before Making the Call</u></h5></span>
					<span ><em>When you need to contact a customer, regardless of what the call is regarding, ensure that you’ve done the following to prepare:</em></span>
				<ul{overflow: hidden;}>
					<li >If you haven’t been the only technician to work on the system...</li>
					<ol>
						<li >Check the System Status Worksheet and the Remedy Work Log to make sure they haven’t been contacted previously by another Technician.</li>
						<li >Briefly review the System Status Worksheet and Remedy Work Log in case the customer asks you any questions about the status of their call.</li>
					</ol>
					<li >Make sure that you’re calling them at a reasonable hour of the day.</li>
					<li >Have the customer’s name and phone number in front of you for reference.</li>
				</ul>

				<span class="indent"/><span ><h5><u>Making the Call</u></h5></span>
					<span >
						If a customer picks up, introduce yourself, where you’re calling from, what you’re calling in regards to, etc. Remember that when customers drop off their systems, they go to the HelpDesk, and as such they might be a bit confused when you say you’re calling from JMU’s CampusNet, but just explain that you work with the HelpDesk and do computer repair and mention that you’re calling in regards to the computer the customer brought in recently. If the customer isn’t there, simply leave a message with the same information you would have provided them over the phone, but be sure to request that they call you back at the HelpDesk number (540.568.3555). Then, update the Remedy Work Log stating why you called the customer and what information you needed from them or wanted to give them. When they contact the HelpDesk, a HelpDesk representative will be able to look at the Work Log, see why you called them in the first place, and gather or deliver the information specified in your entry.</span><br/><br/>
				<span class="indent"/><span ><h5><u>Ending the Call</u></h5></span>
					<span >
						If applicable, let the customer know that you’ll be in touch with them regarding the status of their system and provide them customer with the phone number and hours of the HelpDesk if they have any further questions.<br/>
						Here’s a sample script for calling to let a customer know that her system is available for pick-up:</span>

					<p id="dialogue"><span >
						Technician: “Hi, is this Karen?”<br/>
						Customer: “Yes, who’s this?”<br/>
						Technician: “Hey Karen, this is John calling from JMU’s CampusNet, how’s it going?”<br/>
						Customer: “Good thanks!”<br/>
						Technician: “I’m calling just to let you know that we’ve taken a look at your computer and we were able to remove the malware infections that were giving you problems before. We tested everything and you’re good-to-go.”<br/>
						Customer: “Oh great, thanks so much, so can I come by and pick it up later today?”<br/>
						Technician: “Yep, I'll go ahead and get your computer ready for you, so just come on by the HelpDesk; we’re open until 9:00pm this evening.”<br/>
						Customer: “Okay, sounds good.”<br/>
						Technician: “Also, make sure to bring your JACard with you when you come by, and I see that you checked out a loaner computer, so be sure to bring that back in too.”<br/>
						Customer: “Alright, I’ll make sure I do.”<br/>
						Technician: “Thanks Karen, have a good one.”<br/>
						Customer: “Thank you. Bye!”
						</span>
					</p><br/>

					<span >Remember that each call will be different, and you'll have to adjust accordingly. Below are several different types of calls you might make and information that is specific to each.</span><br/><br/>

					<span ><em>“We need more information...”</em><br/>
						While it’s important not to call customers with any and every question, sometimes it’s necessary to contact a customer to gather important information from them about their call. Occasionally the password provided by the customer will be invalid or the Technician won’t be able to reproduce the issue experienced by the customer. In these instances, make sure you have something to write with and something to write on, prior to making the call.</span><br/><br/>

					<span ><em>“We have an update...”</em><br/>
						If a customer's system is going to take more than a day or two, or if there is an issue that requires sending their system to PCS, letting the customer know what the status of their system is and the estimated time it will take to complete the work on it can put their mind at ease. Since some customers may be more computer-savvy than others, just explain in layman’s terms what the issue is, what the next steps are, and the implications this issue has for hardware, software, and/or data if it is affected.</span><br/><br/>

					<span ><em>“We need your approval...”</em><br/>
						When an OS refresh, hardware replacement (for systems not under warranty), or other procedure -- requiring the customer’s approval -- appears to be the only way to resolve a particular issue, contacting the customer to explain the situation and request permission to proceed is a must. In these circumstances it’s the Technician’s responsibility to provide the customer with all of the information necessary to make a decision, make a recommendation, and run with their decision.</span><br/><br/>

					<span ><em>“A loaner is available for you...”</em><br/>
						Before contacting a customer to let them know a loaner computer is available, it’s worth checking on the status of their call to see if their system is about to be returned. If a customer’s system is almost finished, in the interest of convenience it generally isn’t worth having the customer come over to Frye to pick it up and heading back to their residence hall, only to have to come back to pick up their system later that day. If you skip over a loaner request for this reason, make sure that the customer’s system is returned as soon as it’s ready. Otherwise, when contacting a customer, be sure to remind them to bring their JACard with them when they come by and mention the HelpDesk hours. After hanging up the phone, check out a loaner and put it on the rack.</span><br/><br/>

					<span ><em>“Your computer is ready...”</em><br/>
						<span >Letting a customer know that their system is ready for pick-up is generally pretty straightforward. Let them know the outcome of the work, whether or not we were able to resolve the issue they were experiencing, and inform them that their system will be waiting for them at the HelpDesk. Tell them that they need to bring their JACard with them, as well as a loaner computer if they were issued one. Also mention the HelpDesk hours.</span><br/><br/>

					<strong >Closing the Call</strong><br/>
						<span >When work is completed on a system, before contacting the customer it's important to take care of all documentation related to the call. This includes completing the System Status Worksheet</span><br/><br/>

					<h4 align=center>Using Remedy</h4>

						<strong >Overview</strong><br/>
						<span >Remedy is the client/server application used to track calls and manage relevant customer and system information. Many other work groups such as the HelpDesk, PCS, and Telecom use the Remedy system. The Remedy system is designed to allow multiple work groups to collaborate on a customer's call. Remedy is also used by staff members to log hours.</span><br/><br/>

						<span >On a daily basis you will be updating your calls in Remedy and logging your hours worked for that day.</span><br/><br/>

						<span >Remedy is accessible via the web, http://remedy.jmu.edu/ and via the Remedy User Tool desktop application for Windows; the Remedy client is installed on the staff computers running Windows. Although the Remedy web applications has the same functionality as the desktop application, the latter is much more robust and responsive.</span><br/><br/>

						<span >Use your e-ID and password to access the Remedy system. Once you successfully authenticate, you will be shown the General Control panel screen shown below.</span><br/><br/>

				</span><br/>

				<h4 align=center>Data Recovery</h4>
					<strong><font size=4 color=red>For Windows</font></strong><br/>

					<span ><em>Procedure for copying files from customer's system to the NAS:</em></span>
					<ol>
						<li >From one of the recovery stations in Room 108 or from the customer's system, connect to the NAS.</li>
						<li >Navigate to the userfiles drive, and create a folder with the customer's e-ID.</li>
						<li >Open Y-Copy; for Recovery Stations located on the Desktop, for PE located in the Start menu under All Programs > Data Recovery.</li>
						<li >Navigate to the user's home directory (see below) and look for the Public folder.</li>
						<ul>
							<li ><font color=blue>For Windows XP: <strong>C:\Documents and Settings\(username)</strong></font></li>
							<li ><font color=blue>For Windows Vista/7: <strong>C:\Users\(username)</strong></font></li>
						</ul>
						<li >Check the Public folder and its subfolders for any user files; if found, copy them to the customer's folder on the NAS (the one we created in Step 2).</li>
						<li >Navigate to the aforementioned <strong>Users</strong> folder and copy each all user folders an subfolders to the customer's folder on the NAS.</li>
					</ol>
				<br/><br/>
				
				<span ><em>Procedure for recovering product keys from <strong>C:\Windows\System32\config</strong> folder:</em></span><br/><br/>
					<span >When installing or re-installing an Operating System -- whether on the same drive in the case of OS refresh or a new drive in the case of a hard drive replacement -- we also install several core applications; in order to do this we must have the customer's original product keys for those applications.</span>
						<ol>
							<li >Launch Recover Keys.</li>
							<li >Select the networked computers icon to bring up the popup of the computer selection screen.</li>
							
							<li >Remove the listed <strong>Local computer</strong> because Recover Keys only allows you to select one computer at a time; upon doing this there should be no other computers listed.</li>
							
							<li >Select the <strong>Add</strong> drop-down menu and select <strong>Add another Windows system</strong> from the menu.</li>
							
							<li >Select the <strong>Windows</strong> directory for the hard drive you are recovering keys from. Usually this is the <strong>OS</strong> or <strong>E:</strong> directory.</li>
								
							<li >Make sure the registry hive is selected and click <strong>OK</strong>. This should kick off the recovery process.</li>
								
							<li >Select the floppy disk icon to show the <strong>Export file</strong> drop-down menu, and select "Export to Text file (*.txt)". Navigate to the user's folder on the NAS and save the text file as <strong>(username)-keys.txt</strong>.</li>
							
						</ol>

				<span ><em>Procedure for copying files from NAS to the customer's system:</em></span>
					<ol>
						<li >From the customer's system, connect to the NAS.</li>
						<li >Copy and paste the folder with the customer's first name to the Desktop from the following folder:</li>
						<ul>
							<li ><font color=blue>For Windows XP/Vista/7: <strong>\\cnetnas\userfiles\(customer e-ID)\</strong></font></li>
						</ul>
						<li >Navigate to  <strong>\\cnetnas\tools\</strong> and copy the Z-Copy executable file to the Desktop.</li>
						<li >Launch Z-Copy, selecting as the Source the folder just copied down from the NAS, and selecting as the Destination the folder located at <strong>C:\Users\(username)</strong>.</li>
						<li >Press Start.</li>
						<li >After the file transfer has completed, delete the folder from the Desktop. When the call has been closed, be sure to go back and delete the customer's folder on the NAS to free up space for incoming customers' files.</li>
					</ol>

				<strong><font size=4 color=red>For OS X</font></strong><br/>
					<span ><em>Procedure for copying files from customer's system to the NAS:</em></span>
						<ol>
							<li >From one of the recovery stations in Room 108 or from the customer's system, connect to the NAS.</li>
							<li >Copy the relevant directories (see below) from the customer's system to the NAS.</li>
							<ul>
								<li ><font color=blue><strong>/Users/(username)</strong></font></li>
								<li ><font color=blue><strong>/Applications/Office</strong> (if found)</font></li>
							</ul>
						</ol>
				<span >NOTE: In OS X, product keys are contained within .app files, so there is no need to extract product keys.</span><br/><br/>
					
				<span ><em>Procedure for copying files from NAS to the customer's system:</em></span>
					<ol>
						<li >From the customer's system, connect to the NAS.</li>
						<li >Copy and paste the folder with the customer's first name to the Desktop from the following folder:</li>
						<ul>
							<li ><font color=blue>For Mac OS X: <strong>\\cnetnas\userfiles\(customer e-ID)\</strong></font></li>
						</ul>
						<li >Copy the customer's folder from the NAS to the Desktop.</li>
						<li >After the file copy has finished, copy each of the folders contained in the copied folder, to the appropriate folders (see below); DO NOT copy the <strong>Library</strong> folder.</li>
						<ul>
							<li ><font color=blue><strong>/Users/(username)</strong></font></li>
							<li ><font color=blue><strong>/Applications/Office</strong> (if found)</font></li>
						</ul>
							<li >After the file transfer has completed, delete the folder from the Desktop. When the call has been closed, be sure to go back and delete the customer's folder on the NAS to free up space for incoming customers' files.</li>
					</ol>

					<h4 align=center>Operation System Installations</h4>

					<strong >Windows 7 Installation</strong><br/><br/>
						<span ><em>Before starting this process, ensure the following steps have been completed:</em></span>
							<ul>
								<li >User files backed-up to user's folder on the NAS userfiles drive.</li>
								<li >Product keys backed-up to user's folder on the NAS userfiles drive.</li>
								<li >OS architecture (i.e. 32-bit or 64-bit) and OS version (e.g. Mac OS X <strong>10.6</strong>, Windows 7 <strong>Professional</strong>, etc) recorded on the System Status Worksheet.</li>
								<li >Data recovery information recorded on the back of the System Status Worksheet</li>
								<li >If an OS refresh is being performed: Customer informed of what an OS refresh entails and given their approval for moving forward with the process.</li>
							</ul>

						<span ><em>Once the above steps have been completed, proceed with the following steps:</em></span>
							<ol>
								<li ><a href="http://www.jmu.edu/computing/campusnet/staff/">Boot into PE (Cnet PE [Windows 7])</a>.</li>
								<li >Ensure system is connected to the secure network via an ethernet jack and has an active connection. Also make sure that the system is connected to a power source.</li>
								<li >Select Computer Management from the Desktop.</li>
